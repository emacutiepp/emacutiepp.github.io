Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease is Common
HFMD is common and in the U.S. occurs mostly in the summer and fall, but you can get it any time of year.

Because it is common and usually mild, children can continue to go to child care and schools as long as they:

Have no fever.
Have no uncontrolled drooling with mouth sores.
Feel well enough to participate in classroom activities.
Talk with your childâ€™s healthcare provider if you are still not sure when it is okay for them to return. In some cases, the local health department may require children with HFMD to stay home to control an outbreak.

Common causes of hand, foot, and mouth disease are:

Coxsackievirus A6 can also cause HFMD and the symptoms may be more severe.
Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) has been associated with cases and outbreaks in East and Southeast Asia. Although rare, EV-A71 has been associated with more severe diseases such as encephalitis (swelling of the brain).
